I have conducted an analysis of the level of digital skills in EU countries using data from Eurostat. The analysis focuses on individuals aged 15-74 years old and evaluates their proficiency in five key competences:

- Communication and collaboration skills: This includes assessing individuals' ability to send and receive emails, as well as their usage of social media platforms.
- Digital content creation skills: The analysis examines individuals' proficiency in using word processing or spreadsheet software, as well as their ability to edit photos, videos, or audio files.
- Information and data literacy skills: This competency evaluates individuals' capacity to find information online, such as researching goods or services, and reading online newspapers.
- Problem-solving skills: This involves assessing individuals' capability to engage in online activities like selling goods online, internet banking, and installing software or apps.
- Safety skills: The analysis focuses on individuals' knowledge and practices related to protecting their online presence, such as managing privacy settings on social media platforms and adjusting internet browser configurations.

By examining these competences, the analysis aims to provide insights into the digital skills landscape across different individuals' groups and EU countries.

You can access as well to data on women's representation in the IT industry, including information about age and education levels.
